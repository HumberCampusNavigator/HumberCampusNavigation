### Build Instructions for using 'LSM9DS0 9-axis Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope & Temperature Sensor' on a Raspberry Pi

## System Diagram of the Hardware

```
The above diagram explaines how LSM9DS0 sensor can be used to build an hardware unit which can be used to record the readings coming from the sensor using a Raspberry Pi. The sensor should be solderedd to an header pin and the header pin's other end should be  soldered to  a PCB. The PCB  in trun is soldered to another header pin  on the opposite side where the sensor is attached. The second header pin is then attached to the IO pins of the Raspberry Pi. This whole unit is enclosed in an acrylic case for safety. The Raspberry Pi needs power  and should be connected to a Virtual connection (wired/wireless) for operating Raspberry Pi  remotely by  which we can read the values coming from the sensor.
