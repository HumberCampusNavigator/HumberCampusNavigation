### Build Instructions for using 'LSM9DS0 9-axis Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope & Temperature Sensor' on a Raspberry Pi

In this Project, the aim is to give step by step instructions to build an hardware unit that measures the values coming from the LSM9DS0 sensor. I will be discussing the components needed to build the unit, how much it might cost, various tools that we might need while building up a unit, how to use that tools, and what all are the key factors that should be taken care of . We will start with the system diagram,

## System Diagram of the Hardware

```
  The above diagram explaines how LSM9DS0 sensor can be used to build an hardware unit  which can be used to record the readings coming 
from the sensor using a Raspberry Pi. The sensor should be solderedd to an header pin and the header pin's other end should be soldered
to  a  PCB. The PCB  in trun is soldered to  another header pin  on the opposite side  where the sensor is attached.  The second header 
pin is then attached to  the I/O pins of the Raspberry Pi.  This whole unit is enclosed in an acrylic case for safety. The Raspberry Pi
needs  power  and should be connected to a Virtual  connection (wired/wireless) for operating  Raspberry Pi  remotely  by  which we can 
read the values coming from the sensor.
