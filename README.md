### Build Instructions for using 'LSM9DS0 9-axis Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope & Temperature Sensor' on a Raspberry Pi

In this Project, the aim is to give step by step instructions to build an hardware unit that measures the values coming from the LSM9DS0 sensor. I will be discussing the components needed to build the unit, how much it might cost, various tools that we might need while building up a unit, how to use that tools, and the key factors that should be taken care of . We will start with the system diagram,

## System Diagram of the Hardware

```
  The above diagram explaines how LSM9DS0 sensor can be used to build an hardware unit  which can be used to record the readings coming 
from the sensor using a Raspberry Pi. The sensor should be solderedd to an header pin and the header pin's other end should be soldered
to  a  PCB. The PCB  in trun is soldered to  another header pin  on the opposite side  where the sensor is attached.  The second header 
pin is then attached to  the I/O pins of the Raspberry Pi.  This whole unit is enclosed in an acrylic case for safety. The Raspberry Pi
needs  power  and should be connected to a Virtual  connection (wired/wireless) for operating  Raspberry Pi  remotely  by  which we can 
read the values coming from the sensor.

## The Components needed to make the Unit and its Cost

  If you are a student of a college or University, you most probably will have a Parts Kit which can be used here. You dont need to buy all those things, that you already have which reduces the budget significantly. Anyhow for people starting from scratch I am including all the components needed for the project.
  
  All prices are in Canadian Dollars and include Taxes where ever applicable.

  You can also expect some shipping charges for the components if you are ordering online. You will also need a Laptop or a Desktop to set up the Virtual Connection and operate the Raspberry Pi. Also for printing a 'PCB' and an enclosure(Hard case that holds the entire unit) you might need the help of a Prototype Lab, the cost of which I havent included here. You can get the Raspberry Pi, breadboad & Jumper Wires from Amazon.ca and the LSM9DS0 sensor from robotshop.com. There are several online portals that sell these items, you can shop around and find the cheapest one. This data is just for an overall idea about the budget.
  You can see the pictures of the major components below,
